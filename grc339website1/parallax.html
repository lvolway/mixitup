          <p>As quarantine goes on and travel is limited, I am reflecting on some trips I have taken over the past couple years.
             I am so lucky to have been able to travel with two of my best friends. Last year we went to Europe for Spring Break
             and got to spend a few days here, in Mallorca, Spain. This was by far the most amazing sunset I have ever seen and 
             one of my favorite memories.</p>

          <hr>
          <p>Last summer I took a road trip with my roommate who lives in Denver, Colorado to get her home for the summer. Along the
             way, we got to stop in Moab, Utah and spent a couple hours driving and hiking through the Arches National Park. There 
             were plenty of gorgeous views and red rocks. It was so hot that we couldn't stand to hike around too much but the views
             were incredible, even from the car.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Over winter break my family and I took a quick trip to Fort Bragg, California. The coastal views were beautiful and the
         small town was charming. It was so nice to be with my family and get away to relax during the busy holiday season. I loved 
         walking along the cliffs and taking pictures with my sisters. I would love to go back for a weekend and explore more of the 
         trails along the coast.</p>
